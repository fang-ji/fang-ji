- 👋 Hi, I’m Fang Ji. 
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical modeling and machine learning. 
- 🌱 Some of my research experiences include:
      - developing mathematical models to investigate factors that influence insect outbreaks as well as mechanisms that maintain mutualisms.
      - develping machine learning algorithms to attribute paintings to their respective artists using Convolutional Neural Networks. 
- 💞️ I'm currently teaching myself SQL, data structures, and algorithms.
