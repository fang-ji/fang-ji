Hello! My name is Fang Ji, a recent PhD graduate from the Abbott Theoretical Ecology Lab at Case Western Reserve University. Before grad school, I earned my B.S. in Forestry. During my junior year in college, I took a course on forest pest management, where I learned that insect outbreaks are extremely problematic in many forests around the world. I was surprised to find that the underlying mechanisms and potential solutions for these outbreaks are often unknown. This made me eager to figure out how different ecological factors influence the pattern of insect outbreaks, so I joined Dr. Karen Abbott's lab, where I learned how to build mathematical models and analyze dynamic systems. 

Under the guidance of my advisor and labmates, I completed two modeling projects investigating insect population dynamics in different ecological systems, you can find them **[here](https://github.com/fang-ji/modeling_projects)**. 

Towards the end of my third year in grad school, I was introduced to an interdisciplinary physics / art-history project, where Machine Learning algorithms are used to attribute paintings to their respective artists. That oppotunity really encouraged me to teach myself Machine Learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Python. Soon after I joined the collaboration team, I became the lead code developer. You can read more about this project **[here](https://github.com/hincz-lab/machine-learning-for-art-attribution)**.
