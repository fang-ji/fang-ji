Hello! My name is Fang Ji, a recent PhD graduate from Dr. Karen Abbott's Theoretical Ecology Lab at Case Western Reserve University. Before grad school, I did my undergrad in Forestry. The transition started in my junior year in college when I took a course on forest pest management. From that course I learned that insect outbreaks are extremely problematic in many forests aroung the world, but the underlying mechanisms and potential solutions are often not known. I was eager to figure out how different ecological factors influence the pattern of insect outbreaks, so I joined the Abbott lab to learn how to build mathematical models and analyze dynamical systems. 

Under the guidance of my advisor and post-doc labmates, I did two modeling projects investigating insect population dynamics in different ecological systems, you can find them **[here](https://github.com/fang-ji/modeling_projects)**. 

Towards the end of my third year in grad school, I was introduced to an interdisciplinary physics / art-history project where machine learning algorithms are used to attribute paintings to their respective artists. That oppotunity really encouraged me to teach myself Machine Learning for image processing, especially Convolutional Neural Networks, and Python. Soon after I joined the collaboration team, I became the lead code developer. You can read more about this project **[here](https://github.com/hincz-lab/machine-learning-for-art-attribution)**.

Using the skills I gained from the interdisciplinary physics / art-history project, I applied CNNs to link underlying ecological processes to spatial patterns in community ecology, you can find it **[here](https://github.com/fang-ji/CNN_point_pattern)**.
