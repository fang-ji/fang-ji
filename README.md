- 👋 Hi, I’m Fang Ji. 
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical modeling and machine learning. 
- 🌱 Some of my research experiences include:
  - developing mathematical models to investigate factors that influence insect outbreaks as well as mechanisms that maintain mutualisms.
  - develping machine learning algorithms to attribute paintings to their respective artists using Convolutional Neural Networks. 
- 💞️ I'm currently teaching myself SQL, data structures, and algorithms.

Background
I did my undergrad in Forestry, in my junior year, I took a course on forest pest management. From that course I learned that insect outbreaks are a difficult problem in many forests but the professor never explained the ecological mechanisms behind this phenomenon. I was eager to figure out the ecological mechanisms that influence the pattern of insect outbreaks. Motivated by this, I started my PhD study in Dr. Karen Abbott's theoretical ecology lab at Case Western Reserve University. 

PhD Dissertation Research 
The first project I worked on during my PhD study is using a series of discrete-time models to examine the interaction between insect herbivores and their host plants, and how the interaction affect insect population dynamics. In particular, I focused on the trade-offs between two plant allocation strategies. 

Deep Learning Research
During my third year in grad school, I was introduced to an interdisciplinary collaboration team by friends in Physics department.
